## 👋🏼 Hello World

I am **Mayur Bhoi** (he/him/his). I am a pre-final year student of MIT, Manipal. I have a passion for writing intricately designed software that is efficient and easy to use.

I like to write scripts for automating tasks that are trivial and repetitive but necessary.

My projects are primarily mobile apps for Android-iOS and consist of a wide variety of other technologies and frameworks.

`Java, Dart, C/C++, Python, JS/TS, Bash, Rust, and Go` are some programming languages I can write code in that compiles. (In decreasing order of proficiency and code quality :P)
- **Currently learning**: Operating Systems
- **Currently Practicing**: Competitive Programming
