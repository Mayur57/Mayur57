## 👋🏼 Hello World

I am **Mayur Bhoi** (he/him/his). I am a pre-final year student of MIT, Manipal and have a passion for writing intricately designed software that is efficient and easy to use.

My projects are primarily mobile apps for Android and iOS but also include a wide variety of other technologies too.

- **Currently learning**: Operating Systems

- Some programming languages I can write code in (that works :P):
`Java, Dart, C/C++, Python, JS/TS, Bash, Rust, and Go`

You can contact me via the links in my bio or visit my website [here](https://mayurbhoi.com).
